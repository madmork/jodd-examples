Jodd examples
=============

The idea is to have small, reusable examples of various Jodd tools and frameworks.

Most examples are simple console applications that can be easily executed.
Sometimes, some minor modifications are required, such as e.g. changing the path names etc.
Servlet-related tools and web frameworks are presented in simple web-application.

Examples will be updated to the very latest version of Jodd library,
including the betas.

Don't forget that Jodd test cases are also very good examples, too!

Feel free to contribute and submit your own examples :)


p.s. sorry for not being able to work more on this repo...
